This also applies to our digestive system; knowing the process of the food we ingest up until it leaves our body helps a lot in knowing what we need to eat, what we need to avoid, what we can expect after we eat, and what the effects of the things we want to eat are.  In our laboratory experiment, we made a simulation similar to the digestion of humans by using materials usually available to us. 
                          Humans understand things we observe up close or things taking place in front of us compared to simply reading and watching videos. Thus, making this simulation helps us develop new ideas and gives us a further understanding of the process we are simulating.</p>

                    Q1-6
                    Our system's version of food processing has always started with ingestion. Commonly known as the process of swallowing an edible substance, this stage mainly occurs in one of the most prominent regions of the digestive tract, the mouth. In the beginning of the simulation, this process was demonstrated by throwing bananas and crackers inside a zip-locked bag.The bananas and crackers served as placeholders for the then to be turned "bolus of food". With the help of "salivary amylase", which, in this case, was signified by adding water to the mixture, the food was broken down until it reached a finer texture. After this process, the system of digestion starts, as the bolus of food is physically crushed into a paste-like mixture in the zip-locked bag, which represents the stomache. The outside pressure from the human hand results in a crushing sensation, simulating the strong muscle contractions within the stomach during the process of digestion. Gastric acids then start to aid the stomach in the form of orange juice, representing the addition of pepsin to the bolus of food, as high pH levels have been observed to be present in the two substances.
                    Q7-10
                    The third stage of the digestive tract is the process of absorption. Looking at the simulation, the sock absorbs water, like that of the intestine, and the excess liquid flows out of the socks showing osmosis. Lining the intestine is intestinal lumen, which is represented by the tray which catches the remaining material from the absorption. As it enters the large intestine, the bolus of food from the stomach is then converted into feces after the nutrients are fully absorbed. This is simulated from pouring the wet mixture into a cup and into the sock, which solidifies after a short amount of time. This material is observed to be left in the sock, representing the feces, later being pushed out of the hole that was cut off on the other end of the sock. The feces plops down into an empty plastic cup, presenting the final process of the digestive system, elimination.

                    Q11-Q12
                    We’ve compared a pair of paper towels according to the amount of folds needed for the sole purpose of absorbing water. It was observed that the four-folded paper towel absorbed the most water compared to the other, as the layers created air pockets that aided in fast absorption. This simulation thoroughly presents the small intestine’s role in the digestive system. As this particular organ is lined with villi, microvilli fill each of the villi’s epicells, multiplying the surface area available to satisfy what’s enough for nutrient absorption. As parallels, the small intestine uses its circular folds, aka plicae circulares, for greater nutrient absorption similar to that of the paper towel which uses its folds for water absorption.

                    Bile action in the small intestine was exhibited through the resulting mixture of B as dishwashing liquid caused vegetable oil and water to mix. Bile, being a vital part of mechanical digestion, is released by the liver down to the small intestine to break down triglycerides instead of resorting to chemically breaking down the lipids. This shows that the dishwashing liquid has exhibited the same results.

                    <p class="ex">Like us, our body goes through a constant routine to healthily maintain and manage our everyday external activities. Besides the fun and games, this activity has watered the little branches of knowledge we were left with prior to the eye-opening experience. We learned that food to feces conversion consists of numerous meticulous processes underneath the surface. This includes the release of various enzymes to ease the process of digestion by breaking down the bolus until it’s able to undergo osmosis. Before the latter portion of the chain of events, excretion. 

                      From the chompers chowing down at the entrance, to the never-ending workout our stomach’s muscles have to go through to make it easier for the rest to do their job, every organ in the system has contributed significantly in every successful excretion. The small intestine’s folds utilized in the stage of absorption, and the powers of bile as the main driver for mechanical digestion in the liver, have been tackled as some of the new discoveries we have yet to shed light upon. The digestive system simulation was made to demonstrate, educate, and propagate the minds of future STEM leaders that may take the path of medicine, giving us a glimpse of the mentioned study. Knowing what’s happening inside our bodies may be helpful in increasing further awareness for what digestive ailments and possible mishaps may affect us.</p>
