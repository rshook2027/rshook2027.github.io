                  <h5>Petrarchan Sonnet</h5>
                  <p><i>"Wistful Melodies"</i><br>
                    In verses sung, a tale we can’t undo <br>
                    Leaving me ensnared in a silent space <br>
                    Easier to hate than miss, a cold embrace <br>
                    Yet, I’m reluctant to feel this way for you <br>
                    <br>
                    Already through with thoughts, a heavy view <br>
                    Tired of thinking, weariness to trace <br>
                    Keeping you close, in a loveless chase <br>
                    Honesty would soften this love’s adieu <br>
                    <br>
                    ‘Cause keeping you close, it should be serene <br>
                    If your silent plea was filled with the truth <br>
                    Played with my pride, a complicated scene <br>
                    Making me believe in a false decree <br>
                    But forcing you to stay feels like youth <br>
                    This is the last suit, set my heart free</p>

                  <h5><br>Shakespearean Sonnet</h5>
                  <p><i>"Weekend Echoes"</i><br>
                    In weekend’s outcry, distant and near <br>
                    Open doors, choices lingering wide <br>
                    Thrown into depths, waves of doubt appear <br>
                    Barely afloat, in the tempest’s tide   <br>
                    Begging for notice, a silent plea  <br>
                    Time eludes, a dance in the shadows  <br>
                    Affection withheld, a mystery   <br>
                    Yet, I offer mine in quiet meadows  <br>
                    <br>
                    Curiosity’s yearning, a time of defiance <br> 
                    Out of bounds, out of stock <br>
                    Seeking peace of mind, a need of silence <br>
                    In the search for solace, a tranquil walk <br>
                    <br>
                    Whispers emerge over the weekend recounted <br>
                    In the stillness of resolution, a story reiterated</p>

                      Doth thou remember that night’s waning moon?—<br>
                      Bare were the bruises, and our joyous ode<br>
                      Dwelling in these embalmed chapters we wrote<br>
                      The moonlight, benign, as we mocked silver spoons, <br>
                      Withered like manors turned to ashy dunes<br>
                      Our love, our laughter, and what stars bestowed— <br>
                      Oh my dear maiden, why hath fate forebode? “Distance bore fondness”, the twain did oppugn<br>
                      <br>
                      Must thou oppose the heavens’ refute <br>
                      Tainted by palettes of shaded disdain<br>
                      As red strings encompassed thine coffin beaut’<br>
                      I reserved my sight for thou to obtain<br>
                      For celestine bodies had pleaded “depart!”<br>
                      In astronomy, we're two worlds apart.</p>

                      Evident were the lies thee had conceit—<br>
                      Our existence, condemned, as though stars implored<br>
                      Yet why must I submit to cold deceit—<br>
                      If, an heirloom, is how thee take me for? <br>
                      “Captive” was a title I upheld for thus—<br>
                      Once, I was free of entangled knots<br>
                      Torn were our precious tales collecting dust,<br>
                       As thee dare spoke of thine lady in locks<br>
                      <br>
                      Gone were the nights I served as a hound<br>
                      Dear, here I lie from the stab of a bow<br>
                      I shan’t fear the strings that were deemed to “bound”<br>
                      As hereonforth, I fly free as a crow<br>
                      <br>
                      The night love hath lost as I grew immune<br>
                      Believed to have once been a trick of the moon</p>

                        In this world where only lies are safe to show, <br>
                        An everyday cycle, telling pretty lies that pleases everybody to the core, <br>
                        Being considerate to not hurt anybody anymore. <br>
                        But is it really worth it though? <br>
                        <br>
                        Lies can be told even by those whose knowledge of love is low. <br>
                        Like people who haven't loved, or been loved by anybody before. <br>
                        Saying, “I love you!” Even when there’s really no love in store. <br>
                        Lying to hide the ugly truths no one ever wanted to know. <br>
                        <br>
                        Just one “I love you!” and now everyone is captivated, <br>
                        Can’t take my eyes off you, even knowing everything is untrue; <br>
                        Everything you do seems acted but perfected. <br>
                        Even when it all is a lie, how did you stay calm and collected? <br>
                        Do you wish for that lie to come true? <br>
                        Or do you believe that acting is the only way to ever be accepted?</p>

                        I am stuck in this panorama of time, frozen. <br>
                        Reliving the times that i thought destiny bounded us together, <br>
                        Still had not moved on, still broken, <br>
                        Looking back at moments I wanted to be in forever. <br>
                        <br>
                        As I look at the clear blue sky, memories of us two flash by, <br>
                        Memories I would like to return to, times before everything turned to rubble. <br>
                        Along with my dream that I know I will never reach, no matter how hard I try, <br>
                        Like the future that got out of my grasps, and slipped away as I watched it crumble. <br>
                        <br>
                        I know, I know, I’m filled with loneliness, lacking your affection. <br>
                        With you being colder than before, As you left me here as time passes through. <br>
                        Your change has been very apparent in both your words and actions, <br>
                        Now I'm looking back wondering what it was I'm still holding onto. <br>
                        <br>
